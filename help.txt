9efserv services facilitate in the smooth running of your IRC network.
Much of efserv's functionality is automated. However, some commands can
be given by IRC operators and administrators. Type
/msg services <command> ...
Note that you should always check that it is the real services before
sending passwords or sensitive data to it.
The following commands are available:
- HELP - Prints this message.
- ADMIN <username> <password> - Lets you log in as an administrator.
- JUPE <server> <reason> - Starts a call for votes to jupe.
- JUPE <server> + - Votes for a jupe.
- JUPE <server> - - Votes against a jupe.
Note that a jupe should be regarded as a last resort, and should only
be used in the following situations:
1) Server is possibly compromised/hacked.
2) O-lines are compromised, with no-one to D-line.
3) Trouble with route which breaks the network, causing splits.
Each server gets one, and only one, vote. Anyone on your server can change
your vote once it is placed, although a global operator can not change a
vote which was placed by an administrator.
3 admin votes(the admin must have logged in with ADMIN, or 5 oper
votes result in the activation/deactivation of a jupe.
There are stringent policies in place for dealing with jupe abuse.
