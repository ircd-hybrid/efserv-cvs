This message is the last warning any client from this user@host,
or host if this is due to clients from several usernames, until
all clients from that host log out for an extended period of time.
If any more offenses are detected, you will be reported to all
active monitors on this network. This will probably result in
a network-wide ban. To prevent this from happening, you should
remove any clones you have on the network, and be careful not
to flood the network by changing your nick more than once every
10 seconds.
