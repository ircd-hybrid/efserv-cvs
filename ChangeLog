	* .depend, ChangeLog, Makefile.in, include/serno.h: Repo-moved
	includes/ to include/ so that we can use the ChangeLog and  
	serno.h support in our repository.  Added a cvs2cl.pl generated
	ChangeLog and an empty include/serno.h to seed	 CVS

2001-11-11 19:43  wcampbel

	* channels.c, msg.c, include/config.h: Another update of config.h,

	database.c, efserv.c, log.c, md5.c, msg.c, sconfig.y, utils.c,
	include/config.h, include/define.h: Added a preliminary version of
	includes/config.h, where all the user/admin level compile time
	configuration should go.  Not complete yet, as some stuff isn't
	documented at all or just in define.h

	* channels.c, clones.c: - preliminary cleanups

2001-11-11 16:26  wcampbel

	allow efserv to compile on FreeBSD as well as Linux.  Removed
	GNUism's from Makefile.in Added the appropriate missing #include's
	Minor correction to send_msg() Check for dlopen in libc first,
	before checking -ldl (then set the libs   properly in Makefile.in)
